These notes are meant to describe potential changes to the repository, specific for
the maths lecture

* Intro: it would be useful to draw differences with Dropbox.
        
* Section 1. This seems fine. 

* Section 2. Users have been asked already to connect to their GitHub repository, so
this section isn't entirely permanent. Also, how am I going to pretend I have not
installed GitHub Desktop yet? I am not sure the text at the bottom here is still
relevant

* Section 3. Avoid putting the repo on the Desktop. Not sure the nested repo example
is poignant as an exercise. I propose to replace this by something else. Consider
showing two ways of instantiating a repository, that is, by cloning. IMPORTANT:
discuss with Meron what to do with respect to gitignore: 1. selecting the creation of
gitignore specific for text at runtime and then discover that not all files are
produced. 2. Write the gitignore after a first compilation. I am partial to option 2.

* Section 5. How to make the log file example? Several colleagues would not have an
experience of a log file. I propose here to use something else. I propose to make an
example here around the tex structure. Also, I feel here we should try to be quick,
and move towards more poignant things (like the subsequent sections).

* Section 6. I have some IMPORTANT point to make. Many colleagues of mine will want
to keep their repositories private. At present I achieve this by making a special
request to GitHub. We should explain that this isn't possible in general with a
GitHub account, and tell colleagues about alternatives where private repositories are
possible. Perhaps GitLab? Ideally, it would be nice to have the VU organisation
sorted, so that we can tell people about that too. 

Further in Section 6. I think we need a schematic for the push-pull-local-remote. I
do have some ideas about that.

I have not worked yet on Section 7 for conflicts
